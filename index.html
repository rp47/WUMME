  <title>Sorry</title>
<body>
  <p> If you ever seeing this I want to let you know I never doubted you.</p>
  <p> It was not until fights, I realised the context. I had a whole different interpretation of incident. I thought you were hurt bcz you really liked me and i never understood it. but later only I understood you were under the misconception</p>
  <p> For what I can say is I never asked about any of your previous relationship ever. If I had ever doubted you I would have directly asked it</p>
  <p> I know its hard to believe, but that is the truth. This may never change what hapened</p>
  <p> But just wanted you to forgive and not curse me. All of the incidednt could have been avoided if you ever replied calm to me or if I handled it better</p>
  <p>After all what happened, I didnt have energy or courage to ping you </p>p>
  <p>whatever happened happended. Wish you all success in life and future. </p>
